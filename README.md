Indesign scripts for resizing selected frame to the nearest grid line
=====================================================================

Written in Javascript

Simple scripts for resizing selected frame to the nearest grid line vertically and horizontally. Inspired by [this](https://github.com/alssndro/sandros-sketch-plugins/blob/master/Alignment%20(Vertical)/Align%20Bottom%20To%20Baseline%20Grid.sketchplugin) plugin for Sketch. 

Horizontal resize step will depend on document grid horizontal step (base, not subdivisions) set in Preferences. 
Vertical resize step will depend on baseline grid increment.

I assigned shortcuts to these scripts: `cmd+ctrl+shift+up` and `cmd+ctrl+shift+down` for vertical commands, `ctrl+shift+left`, `ctrl+shift+right` for increasing frame width from left and right sides and `ctrl+shift+alt+left`, `ctrl+shift+alt+right` for shrinking frame width.
