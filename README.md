These JSX scripts for Indesign are mostly written by me with the help of guys from [Adobe Forums](http://forums.adobe.com). The main puprose they have is to alleviate working in Indesign with keyboard shortcuts by adding control from keyboard to those functions that currently don't have it. These include:

- resizing frames by document and baseline grid divisions;
- quickly setting keyboard increments;
- flexibly controlling opacity, stroke weight and tint;
- starting to edit text in the currently selected frame from keyboard;
- invert text case;
- moving objects to another layer;
- opening selection in new window â€” I use this as a trick for editing in one (often little) window, viewing the result without selection frames in another as it's not possible to hide frame edges for the current selection like in Sketch;
- selecting swatches from keyboard that doesn't mess with Swatches palette state;
- selecting current word (you can use [this script](http://jsid.blogspot.com.ee/2007/08/selecting-paragraphs.html) for selecting paragraphs);
- toggle different vertical justification modes from keyboard 
- and others.

I hope you find it useful and offer your ideas and suggestions.
